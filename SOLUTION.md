# SMTP Server Challenge Solution

## ✅ **COMPLETED**: Full SMTP Server Implementation in .NET

I have successfully solved the SMTP Server Challenge from [Coding Challenge #90](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-90-smtp-server) using .NET 8.0.

### 🎯 Challenge Completion Status

**All Steps Implemented:**
- ✅ **Step 1**: TCP server listening on port 25 with 220 greeting response
- ✅ **Step 2**: HELO/EHLO command support for client identification  
- ✅ **Step 3**: MAIL FROM and RCPT TO command handling for email headers
- ✅ **Step 4**: DATA command with full email body processing and RFC transparency handling
- ✅ **Step 5**: Concurrent client support using async/await patterns

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**SmtpServerCore**: Main server class that handles TCP connections on port 25, manages concurrent clients, and implements graceful shutdown.

**SmtpSession**: Individual client session handler that implements the SMTP protocol state machine, parses commands, validates sequences, and processes email data.

**SmtpTestClient**: Testing client that demonstrates proper SMTP communication flow and validates server functionality.

### 🔧 Key Features

- **RFC 5321 Compliance**: Proper response codes, command validation, and error handling
- **Data Transparency**: Handles dot-stuffing according to SMTP transparency rules  
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- **Email Storage**: Received emails are saved with timestamps to the `emails/` directory
- **State Machine**: Proper SMTP session state tracking and command sequence validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses and network disconnection handling

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   cd SmtpServer
   dotnet run
   ```
   *Note: May require administrator privileges for port 25*

2. **Test with Client**:
   ```bash
   cd SmtpClient  
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Manual Testing with Telnet**:
   ```bash
   telnet localhost 25
   HELO test.local
   MAIL FROM:<sender@example.com>
   RCPT TO:<recipient@example.com>
   DATA
   Subject: Test Message
   
   Hello World!
   .
   QUIT
   ```

### 📧 SMTP Commands Supported

| Command | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| HELO/EHLO | ✅ | Client identification |
| MAIL FROM | ✅ | Sender specification |
| RCPT TO | ✅ | Recipient specification |  
| DATA | ✅ | Email content transfer |
| RSET | ✅ | Session reset |
| QUIT | ✅ | Connection termination |
| NOOP | ✅ | No operation |

### 🎯 Going Further

This implementation provides a solid foundation that could be extended with:
- Authentication (AUTH command)
- TLS encryption (STARTTLS) 
- Email queue management
- POP3/IMAP server integration
- Advanced logging and monitoring
